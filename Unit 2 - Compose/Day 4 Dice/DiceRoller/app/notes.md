# Start
 - Build app called dicerollerInClass
 - Delete almost everything in main activity
 - build out DiceWithButtonAndImage
 - Add button in `DiceWithButtonAndImage` within the Column
 - Leave /*TODO*/ for later

# Add image
- [Import images](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-add-images#1)
- Give students zip of images
- Look at images in text editer
- Explain what is diff about them
- Add Image() into `DiceWithButtonAndImage` before Button
- Add description "1"
- Run app
- Add Spacer()

# Building Logic
- Replace /*TODO*/ with lamda
- ranges are designated by two periods between the first number 
  in the range and the last number in the range
- [When statement](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html#when-expression)
- Composables are stateless by default, 
which means that they don't hold a value and can be recomposed any time by the system, 
which results in the value being reset.
- Add switch statment 
- RUN EOD
